Simple application to test network connections between two hosts.

Tests are:
1. Open a connection to the another host
2. Open and hold a connection to the other host
3. Small file transfers. Send a burst of small data packets and handshake their checksums.
3. Large binary transfer. Calculate speed and calculate their checksums.
